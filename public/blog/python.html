              Python learning roadmap
            </h1>
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
              Python is known as the most popular programming language and since
              it is used in many areas, it can be used in many different
              situations. <br />
              On the other hand, since Python is very easy to learn and has a
              shorter syntax than other programming languages, it can be learned
              in the shortest possible time. <br />
              In this exclusive article from the Rocket website, we are going to
              introduce you step by step with the topics you need to learn
              Python. <br />
              Of course, learning Python can be much easier than learning many
              other programming languages.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              First step: Knowing Python and understanding the Python project
            </h2>
            <img src="../../../assest/image/python/1.jpg" alt="" />
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600 pt-6">
              In the first step, it is very important to have a general
              understanding of what the Python programming language is and why
              it was created. Also, learning the strengths and weaknesses of
              Python will give you the power to make a more logical decision to
              learn it.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              Second step: learning basic commands
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
              Every programming language has a set of basic commands that you
              should work with in the first step of learning. Python is no
              exception to this rule and by learning these basic commands, you
              can learn the general written form of the Python programming
              language. If you have worked with other programming languages
              before, it is possible that Python is very strange to you because
              Python uses its unique syntax and has its own block system. Basic
              Python commands include commands such as printing text, variables,
              creating loops, conditions, functions, handling errors, working
              with Python data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries) and
              recognizing internal functions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              The third step: learning data structures and algorithms
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
              After learning the basic commands, it's time to learn how to
              implement different data structures (linked lists, arrays, hash
              tables, etc.) learn to Learning these things will help you learn
              and work with programming structures in a much deeper way.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              Fourth step: learning more professional subjects
            </h2>
            <img src="../../../assest/image/python/2.png" alt="" />
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600 pt-5">
              After learning basic subjects, it is time to learn more
              professional subjects. In the field of Python programming, these
              professional topics can have different aspects. <br /><br />

              The first step is learning object-oriented programming. In order
              to do such a task, you must first get familiar with the concept of
              object orientation and then start learning the features of Python.
              Classes, inheritance, defining methods, constructors, working with
              Dunder Methods, etc. are among the things you need to learn
              object-oriented programming. <br />

              In the second step, it is very necessary to learn RegEx or regular
              expressions as another advanced programming topic. You have to
              learn the process of working and finding patterns of text,
              numbers, characters, etc. in different disciplines. <br />

              Working with modules and how they interact is another important
              issue that you should learn in the field of professional
              programming. <br /><br />

              It is also essential to work with tools that enable interactive
              programming. Among these things, we can refer to Generator, Map,
              Filter, Zip, iterators, etc. functions.
            </p>
            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              The fifth step: Learning the package manager
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
              Python has provided us with a tool called pip to manage packages
              in a project. Using pip, you have the ability to install and
              remove different packages and in this way you can prepare the
              requirements of your project. Working with the pip package manager
              is simple and is another step to learn Python more deeply.

            <h2 class="py-6 text-xl md:text-2xl">
              Python programming job market
            </h2>
            <p class="text-base text-gray-600">
              The Python programming job market in the world offers diverse and
              attractive job opportunities due to its unique features and
              inclusiveness. Because of its simplicity, power, and high
              flexibility, Python has a special place among programming
              languages and is used in many areas such as web development,
              automation, software testing, and daily activities​​​.​
              <br /><br />

              Python-related job positions include Python programmer, data
              analyst, data scientist, quality control engineer, Python web
              developer, and machine learning and deep learning engineer. Demand
              for Python developers is high globally, providing numerous career
              opportunities in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence,
              machine learning, and data analytics. <br /><br />

              In Afghanistan, Python has gradually established its position and
              has become one of the most widely used programming languages. The
              Python job market in Iran has grown significantly and job
              opportunities in this field are gradually increasing. People who
              are experts in this language can register on foreign freelance
              sites and do projects with dollar income. <br /><br />

              The amount of income in the field of Python varies depending on
              the job position and skill level of people. In Iran, the average
              salary of a Python programmer varies between 15 and 50 million
              Tomans, while in countries such as America, Canada, and Germany,
              this amount is between 50,000 and 90,000 dollars per year.
